React + TS Article App
For this project, the approach was to create a React application with a simple frontend interface for displaying a list of articles fetched from a server. The main focus was on implementing error handling for data fetching, providing a smooth user experience, and ensuring robustness in the face of potential network issues.

Technologies Used:

React + TS : Used for building the frontend user interface components.
axios: Utilized for making HTTP requests to fetch data from the server.
Material-UI: Employed for styling and UI components to enhance the visual presentation of the application.
Challenges Faced:

Error Handling During Data Fetching:

One of the primary challenges was implementing robust error handling for data fetching. This involved handling various types of errors, including network issues, server errors, and unexpected data structures.
Dealing with transient network issues and ensuring that the application gracefully recovers from them without disrupting the user experience was a key challenge.
Retrying Failed Requests:

Implementing a retry mechanism for failed HTTP requests while avoiding infinite retry loops or excessive server load posed a challenge.
Balancing the number of retry attempts and the frequency of retries to optimize for successful data fetching without overloading the server or causing delays for the user was crucial.
Approach to Challenges:

Error Handling Strategy:

Developed a comprehensive error handling strategy that categorizes errors based on their nature and provides appropriate feedback to the user.
Leveraged React's state management to efficiently manage loading, error, and retry states within the components.
Retry Mechanism Implementation:

Implemented a retry mechanism with a finite number of retry attempts to mitigate transient network issues and recover from server errors.
Throttled retry attempts to prevent overwhelming the server with excessive requests and to ensure a smooth user experience.
Conclusion:

Overall, by adopting a systematic approach to error handling, implementing a retry mechanism, and leveraging appropriate technologies, the project successfully addressed the challenges associated with data fetching and provided a robust frontend interface for displaying articles. Continuous testing and refinement were key to ensuring the reliability and performance of the application.
